## Introduction

Tiger Paws a botique stuffed toy retail outlet, has requested a website consisting of a home page, a **Catalog** page, a **Discussion** page, and a **Communication** page. This proposal is written to Tiger Paws to outline their needs and how we at Skillage I.T can ensure they are met within the guidelines mentioned in this document.

Skillage I.T has a strong background of building websites and offering I.T solutions, including but not limited to:

1. **Online Backups**. We provide server space and Always Online    connections so businesses may backup their important data offsite.

2. **Online Payment Processing**. Skillage I.T provides EFT services, helping to process payments and manage all communications with payment providers and the Banks.

3. **Online Shopping**. We provide a simple shopping service where our clients can list their items for sale on our Web Portal and their customers can browse, purchase and review utilizing our state of the art infrastructure.

4. **Web Site design & Hosting**. Most importantly in Tiger Paws' case, we offer a complete package of ***Website Design, Development, Testing, and Hosting*** on our cloud infrastructure.

## Problem statement

Lately Tiger Paws has noticed some drastic loss in revenue, and after surveying their customers, they've found that it is due to one main issue *"Time"*. This is due to the commitments of a modern day family and the fact that it is very hard to find time out of a busy family schedule to go stuffed toy shopping.

This loss of revenue is also due to the fact the Tiger Paws does not have an online presence. In our experiences we've found that stores without an online presence go out of business generally very quickly unless we can get them a Website Designed by specialist I.T professionals.

The user base is found to be parents in their 20s with some grandparents and great grandparents in the mix. It seems the older generation has been with Tiger Paws for a long time, so we will need to ensure catering for the accessability of the older generations.  

## Goals/proposed solutions

As per the conversation with Tiger Paws, to address these concerns we will need to design a website that contains the following:

* A **Home Page**  - where people can see specials that they have along with any announcements they would like the community to know about. This needs to incorporate a new logo designed by Skillage I.T.

* A **Catalog Page**  - showing the different stuffed toys they have available for purchase. Needs to be an online catalog and not a sales focussed shopping page.

* A **Discussion Page**  - Where Tiger Paws members can post and have discussions with other community members.

* A **Communication Page**  - This page will allow users to get in touch with Tiger Paws via email with any questions, and the page should also host their general contact info.  

Tiger Paws have advised that the site does not need to be responsive in design (mobile friendly), but we will do this at no extra cost for two reasons:

1. Parents in their 20's use mobiles more than they use normal computers.

2. Eventually the site will need to be responsive (as most if not all websites are these days), so instead of having to rewrite the website in the future we will ensure it is responsive now and make it easier to upgrade/update in the future.

As we are expecting elderly/disabled users accessing the site, we will need to ensure that the site is compliant with the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 2.0** (WCAG) AA standard.


## Standard package breakdown

The site will be designed primarily with the Bootstrap Framework and Javascript for the user Interface.

We are looking to use C# for controlling the server processing.

SQL will be used for the handling and storage of any data.

**Home Page** - $600 - A responsive homepage with logo designed by Skillage I.T. This is to contain specials and announcements for the Tiger Paws community.

No extra cost - Ensure site is compatible with all modern day browsers
